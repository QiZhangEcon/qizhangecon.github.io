excerpt: >
  We exploit the “call” system, where a senior downstream user’s call temporarily suspends 
  upstream junior withdrawals, to study the dynamic effects of water-right enforcement. Using 
  an event-study design comparing affected structures to never-called structures, we aim to causally 
  estimate how calls alter water-use behavior and assess implications for overall water-use efficiency.
