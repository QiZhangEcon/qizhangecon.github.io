  The Pollution Haven Effect (PHE) predicts that environmental regulation shifts pollution-intensive production toward less regulated regions. This paper   tests the PHE within a single country by examining the Key Cities Air Pollution Control policy, a city-specific air quality program in China. Using a synthetic difference-in-differences design to correct for targeted policy placement, I estimate the policy’s effects on sulfur dioxide emissions and industrial composition in treated and neighboring cities. The results reveal limited overall emission reductions but clear evidence of spatial reallocation: under half a decade, treated cities shift pollution toward cleaner sectors, while neighboring cities expand output and capital in pollution-intensive industries, consistent with inter-city pollution leakage. Further analysis shows that this reallocation was driven largely by provincial governments strategically using state-owned enterprises to redistribute production, with a secondary role for firm-level product switching. These findings demonstrate that environmental regulation can generate PHE-type outcomes in the short term, driven by non-market forces, and that well-intentioned policies may reshape regional industrial structures in unintended ways.
